    <h3>1.Explained: In criticism & lawsuit, debate over coding for kids</h1>
        <h4>(i) Why is learning to code a big deal?</h4>
        <p>
            At the turn of this century, when extremely affordable computers made their way into technical and
            engineering colleges across the country, India was able to produce a huge army of coders and
            programmer—essentially people who could create computer software.

            As computing devices have taken over every aspect of life, the need for good programmers and coders has been
            increasing relentlessly — and calls to teach coding and programming to young students have got louder. In
            recent years, platforms and companies have started to claim that kids as young as those in elementary school
            must begin to learn coding.
        </p>
        <h4>(ii) How did the call to start teaching code to children in elementary school come about?</h4>
        <p>Since the advent of computers and the arrival of computer coding as the next big thing, leaders of technology
            companies around the world have pushed for coding to be included as a subject in middle or higher secondary
            school for students who may be interested to learn.

            In 2018, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates wrote in a blog post that everyone could benefit from learning the
            basics of computer science. According to Gates, coding, which he taught himself and fell in love with at the
            age of 13, led him to ask questions about how to achieve tasks, and find answers to questions.

            “The questions it teaches you to ask — How do you accomplish a task? Can you find a pattern? What data do
            you need? — are useful no matter where you go in life,” Gates wrote.</p>
        <h4>(iv) What do the critics of code-learning at an early age say?</h4>
        <p>The primary contention against learning to code at a very young age is that some age groups, which are being
            targeted by platforms, are being pushed into it even before they have mastered the mathematical and
            technological fundamentals.

            A metaphor that is often used is that children are being made to ride a bicycle before they have even learnt
            to walk. Software engineer Pradeep Poonia, 30, a vocal critic who has become a prominent voice in the
            debate, says: “There’s a reason why in mathematics addition is taught first, then subtraction, then
            multiplication, and then division. It is necessary to learn several elements of mathematics and logical
            thinking before one can code. [What many of the online platforms are doing these days] is like someone
            teaching you to draw a car under the pretext of making you learn how to build a car.”</p>
